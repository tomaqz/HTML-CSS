# HTML-CSS
For HTML-CSS Web Development Course - Training and Learning - SouthWest Tech - Tomas Quiroz

### A description for why the repository exist (what files does it hold and why are they significant?)
This repository will be for my upcoming web development course which will require delving into the workings of HTML5 along with CSS. Perhaps I will branch out to incorporate other programming languages if allowed. The repo will hold index, image, and style sheet files for the production of my course project and perhaps may even include some media that I might produce.
